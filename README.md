# spotify-cli

Work in progress...

Currently, the following issue is stopping me: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/2999

## Installation
- Clone repo
- `cd spotify-cli && npm i && npm link`
- Create `.env` file based on sample
- Run `spotify-cli`

## Commands
`spotify-cli` enters REPL mode and allows you to control the player using the following commands:

- `> login`
- `> play <playlist name>` tab autocompletes list names
- `> stop`
- `> pause`

If you have any suggestions, please open an issue :)
